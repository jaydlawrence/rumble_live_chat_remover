# Rumble Live Chat Remover

This is a colaboration between me and chatGPT to remove the chat window on rumble videos and remove the max width on the video.

## Installation

Download this repository and unzip to a file.

According to chatGPT, these are the rest of the steps:

- Open Google Chrome and go to the Extensions page. (chrome://extensions/)
- Enable the "Developer mode" toggle in the top right corner.
- Click on the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder containing your extension files.
- The extension should now be installed and active. Open a Rumble video page, and the live chat block should be removed, and the stream-post-wrapper__post element should have 100% width.
